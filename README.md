# 🎶 Chinook Data Warehouse Project

📌 **Tools Used**: Snowflake, dbt, Power BI, Excel  
📁 **Dataset**: Chinook Database (Artists, Albums, Tracks, Customers, Sales)  
📈 **Goal**: Transform the Chinook relational database into a data warehouse for enhanced analytical capabilities and create Business Intelligence (BI) dashboards for strategic decision-making.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project involves transforming the **Chinook** database into a structured **Data Warehouse** using **Snowflake** and **dbt**. The goal is to optimize data storage, improve accessibility, and facilitate advanced analytics through **Power BI** visualizations. We created multiple fact tables and dimension tables to support multidimensional analysis.

### 🔄 Data Transformation Pipeline

- **ETL Process**: Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) data using dbt and load into Snowflake.
- **Dimensional Modeling**: Created fact tables such as `fact_song_sales`, `fact_artist_release_analysis`, `fact_track_inventory_analysis`, and `fact_track_review` for analytical purposes.
- **Business Intelligence Dashboards**: Built interactive dashboards in Power BI for sales analysis, track inventory, and artist performance.

## 🧠 Key Features Engineered

- **Fact Tables**: Centralized tables for transactional data (e.g., song sales, artist releases).
- **Dimension Tables**: Organized related data (e.g., customers, songs, time) to support efficient querying.
- **Snowflake Schema**: Structured data into facts and dimensions for fast analytical queries.
- **Power BI Dashboards**: Visualized sales trends, artist contributions, and customer demographics.
